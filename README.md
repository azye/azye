# Hello Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a Software Engineer based in the Bay Area. I love tackling code problems of all kinds but my areas of focus are in: 

- general backend web development
- cloud and data center architectures
- distributed web systems, databases
- productivity tooling

My next challenges are working on machine learning and parallel computing.

My _primary_ technologies I currently work with are *Go*, *Python*, and *Kubernetes/Docker*.
